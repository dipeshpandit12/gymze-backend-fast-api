## ‚ú® **Core Features**  

### **Video Processing System**  
- Accepts video URLs and user IDs via the `/process-video` endpoint.  
- Validates the successful upload of the video by communicating with the Next.js frontend.  
- Downloads the video and stores it in a temporary folder.  
- Extracts frames from the video to detect gym equipment using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model.  
- Returns the following as a response:  
  - Unique detected equipment  
  - User ID  
  - Video URL  

### **Queue System**  
- Handles multiple requests by processing videos sequentially in a queue.  

### **Storage Optimization**  
- Deletes downloaded videos after processing to conserve storage space.

## ü§ñ **AI Model Development**  

### **YOLOv8 Custom Model**  
- **Dataset Preparation**:  
  - Annotated a dataset of 400 gym equipment images, covering a wide variety of equipment types and perspectives.  
- **Model Training**:  
  - Trained the YOLOv8 model using this annotated dataset.  
  - Achieved an accuracy of **60-70%**, sufficient for detecting gym equipment effectively in video frames.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Real-time equipment detection.  
  - High accuracy for identifying unique gym equipment.
